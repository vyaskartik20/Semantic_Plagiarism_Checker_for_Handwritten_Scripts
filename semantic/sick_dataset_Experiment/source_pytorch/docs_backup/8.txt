To read and write image file we have to import the File class [ import java.io.File; ]. This class represents file and directory path names in general.
To handle errors we use the IOException class [ import java.io.IOException; ]
To hold the image we create the BufferedImage object for that we use BufferedImage class [ import java.awt.image.BufferedImage; ]. This object is used to store an image in RAM.
To perform the image read write operation we will import the ImageIO class [ import javax.imageio.ImageIO;]. This class has static methods to read and write an image.

In the next set we will be learning how to get and set the pixel value of images in JAVA.
