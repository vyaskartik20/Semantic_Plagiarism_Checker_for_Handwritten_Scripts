database management system scanned with camscanneruniquely identifies the types of the relation.this is called the primary key of the relation.in the given tables: so, pm and(so, pm) are primary key of the tables supplier, parts and up respectively.advantages: a) user friendly representation.given a query: .find st for suppliers who supply pts i...find it for parts supplied by a+ is".both the queries incorporate similar search types and are symmetric.in the relational model, symmetric query solving is symmetric and poses no problem.ii) storage operations(insertion, deletion, update on) are simple to make.hierarchical model: pants nut red of folk tape pm.suppliers a.rage ram mumbai 30081....of psi...of is a.a.dharma collect a of a> at incorporated co relationship maintenance.(we might have placed supplier at the root instead of"parts") entities are represented as free structures.the structure implies the relationship.: ) in this particular relation, "part"is superior to"supplier"for each part, there may be more than one supplier record occurrences.each supplies record also contains the shipment scanned with camscannerquantity.the association is represented by the parent child relationship, hence the name.iii) in general, the roof may have any number of depend once.each of these may again have any number of depend dances and so on.in> asymmetric structure not convenient for use advantages and disadvantages: a) symmetric query solving is not symmetric.a) the hierarchical model possesses certain undesirable properties with respect to storage operations.insert: to introduce a new supplier, dummy parts are to be introduced unless the supplier supplies some part.delete: deleting a shipment information is to delete the supplier record, implying that we may lose all information about the supplier, if it happens to bethe only shipment for the supplier.update: problems due to redundant occurrences.any change, in say city of a supplier, requires searching through"the entire database for all such supplier records..a) the advantage is the naturalness, as natural processes are inherently hierarchical..network model: an extension of the hierarchical model.sib.rage ram mumbai a.a.dharma kolkatak3002001400300pl...pm pm...scanned with camscannerremark: data is represented as records and links.entity oct us as records and associations as links.more general than hierarchical structure connector chain represents shipment quantities.no concepts of superiors and dependence.each connector occurrence links only one supplies and only one part.advantages and disadvantages: a) symmetric query solving is symmetric.of) storage operations are simple.of a) disadvantage is the complexity of links.relational database deign: relational..the output of a data real designhierarchialbase design is the uverwoldnetworkview.sites the responsibility of the aba to design the database, a assigning the related data items of the database to columns of tables(with respect to a relational model) , ina manner that preserves durable properties.the database designer has to consider many issues at the same time.the final output of the logical database design process is the were schema, since the users schema rep regents the database designers solution.the users schemata are usually difficult to understand and change.the designer is construed by the limited data structure types supported by the database system(since the designer has to keep in mind the access paths.the search strategies are dependant on scanned with cams annette conceptual schema.) the designer may have to consider the access paths of the record, i.a., how to access a particular record type.the designer may have to consider how to make the set several and updating more efficient.there are two common technologies entity relationship approach and normalization approach towards database design.however, it turns out that the relational design bound on either approach transform into relational form having nearly identical results, and in fact, the two approaches reinforce each other.or approach: the key idea to the or approach is to concentrate on the conceptual schema.at this stage, the designer should view the data from the point of view of the whole enterprise."this description is called enter use conceptual schema or enterprise schema.this should be a pure representation of the real world and independent of storage and efficiency considerations.the de sign process can be viewed as a a phase process.design enterprise schema..translate enterprise schema to user schema for the data blue system..advantages of the a phase approach, a) the database design process becomes simpler and better organized.") the enterprise schema is easier to design than the final schema, since, it need not be a restricted by the can
