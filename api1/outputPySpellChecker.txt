will compute to complete its designated task How many data items the transaction has used and how many goethe transaction needs for it to complete p. How many transactions will be involved in the roll back.*. How many times a single transaction has been scaled back starvation prevention ) be Rollback: Once the victim selection is over it must be determined to how far this transaction should be rolled back , The simplest so elution is total scollback ( abort ) and srestent.However , it is more effective to scroll back the transaction only afar as necessary to break the deadlock , but this method requires theSystem to maintain additional information about the state of all thesunning transactions c ) starvation In a system where the victim selection is based cost factors it may happen that the same transaction is always picked a victim . As a result , this transaction never completes its design ted task this situation is called strawation.One solution to avoid starvation is to include the number of roll backs in the cast factor .1 ) lovelock Another problem that may occur when it uses locking "velock. A transaction is in a state of uvelock, if it cannon proceedfor an indefinite period of time , while other transactions in the sys item continue normally This may accent if the waiting scheme for lock bed items is unfair , giving porosity to some transactions over others.The standard solution to lovelock , is to follow a scheme that uses FIFO queue , where transactions are enabled to lock an item in theories in which they originally requested to lock the item.Basic Timestamp Ordering ( To ) protocol : Another approach that quay canteen serializability, involves using transaction timestamps to ordeltransaction executions for an equivalent serial schedule scanned with CamScanner
