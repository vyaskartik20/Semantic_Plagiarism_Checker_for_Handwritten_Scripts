will compute to complete its designate task.. Now many data items the transaction has used, and how many morethe transaction needs for it to complete .. Now many transactions will be involved in the roll back.*. Now many times a single transaction has been scale back,( starvation prevention ) .b) Rollback: Once the victim selection is over, it must be determined to how far this transaction should be rolled back , The simplest so -lotion is total scollback ( abort ) and present.However , it is more effective to scold back the transaction only afar as necessary to break the deadlock , But, this method requires theSystem to maintain additional information about the state of all thesunning transactions .C ) starvation: In a system where the victim selection is based cost factors, it may happen that the same transaction is always picked a victim . Is a result , this transaction never complete its design -ted task. this situation is called starvation.One solution to avoid starvation is to include the number of roll -backs in the cast factor .1 ) Livelock: Another problem that may occur when it uses locking "clock. A transaction is in a state of uvelock, if it cannot proceedfor an indefinite period of time , while other transactions in the says -them continue normally. His may accent if the waiting scheme for lock -ed items is unfair , giving curiosity to some transactions over others.The standard solution to livelock , is to follow a scheme that uses FIFO queue , where transactions are enabled to lock an item in theories in which they originally requested to lock the item.Basic Timestamp Ordering ( To ) protocol : Another approach that quay -knees serializability, involves using transaction timestamps to ordeltransaction executions for an equivalent aerial schedule .Scanned with CamScanner
