the conceptual schema, 1, 0. the designer may have to consider the access paths of the record i, 6, 0. a, 2, 9081174698. how to access a particular record type, 3, 0. the designer may have to consider how to make the memory real and updating more efficient, 8, 0. there are two common technologies entity relationship approach and normalization approach towards database design, 6, 0. however it turns out that the relational design bound on either approach transform into relational form having nearly identical results and in fact the two approaches reinforce each other, 12, 0. , 0, 1024908267229. a, 1, 9081174698. or approach the key idea to the or approach is to concentrate on the conceptual schema, 11, 0. at this stage the designer should view the data from the point of view of the whole enterprise, 6, 0. this description is called enter use conceptual schema or enter use schema, 9, 0. this should be a pure representation of the real world and independent of storage and efficiency considerations, 4, 0. the de sign process can be viewed as a a phase process, 9, 0. design enterprise schema, 2, 0. , 0, 1024908267229. translate enterprise schema to user schema for the data bole system, 4, 0. , 0, 1024908267229. advantages of the a phase approach a the database design process becomes simpler and better organized, 9, 0. a the enterprise schema is easier to design than the final schema since it need not be quest rioted by the capabilities of the data scanned with cam scanner, 15, 0.
